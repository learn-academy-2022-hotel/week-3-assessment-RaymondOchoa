# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is essentially an extension to javascript. Syntax wise the main difference is that in JSX we use className instead of just class like we would in HTML.

Researched answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML, it is an extension to Javascript that makes it easy to write and add HTML in react. It does this by converting HTML tags into react elements. A syntax difference between JSX and HTML is that JSX uses "className" instead of HTML's "class" because "class" is already a protected word in javascript meaning that it cannot be used as an any other type of identifier. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager, it stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. Yarn will basically create the a skeleton of a React app. Once you run yarn start you will open a browser where you can see the changes you made to your code. 

Researched answer: Yarn is both a package and a project manager. A package manager is a collection of tools that help you install, remove, modify, or upgrade computer programs. The commands yarn start and yarn create are both commonly used as well, yarn start will open a browser with a  localhost:3000 address and yarn create will make a directory that has all the files and installs all the node module dependencies to get a bare bones app that you can now work on.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: React components are pieces of reusable code that work similar to javascript but return HTML. 

Researched answer: Components are a specific type of function that can contain javascript logic and returns markup that gets rendered to the browser. This essentially means that you can write javascript like code and react will return the changes made through the DOM in your browser on the local.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: React state values are values that we assign to a useState method so that it passes the information through. Props, or Properties refers to the 

Researched answer: React state values and props are both Javascript objects that hold information that affect the output of the code, but props get passed to the component while the state values get integrated within the component. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model, this refers to what you can see and interact with while working. 

Researched answer: The document object model is a programming interface for web documents, it displays what you are currently working on so you can actively make changes to the structure, style, or content. The DOM is not a programming language but it is written in Javascript

6. *** STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div tag is used to modify a section of the document, i'm not exactly sure what a span tag would do. 

Researched answer: Div tags are block level elements, they can be used to divide page content into blocks. They are commonly used in relation to paragraphs, images, headings etc. The div names also allow us to reference them in css and modify them accordingly. Span tags are also used to style and organize the document but these types of tags only take up as much space on the page as its content so it doesn't start a new line. This means that you can style single lines or even parts of a single line of text within a document.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object oriented programming is a programming model that focuses on data and objects rather than functions and logic. In other words, OOP works on the objects that we want to manipulate instead of the logic it requires to manipulate them. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language that uses objected orientated programming and increased code reuse to aid in efficiency. It is commonly used to build desktop applications, static websites, and data processing services. Ruby also works in conjuction with the Rails framework to make it more user friendly by housing pre written code for things like communication or file handling. 

3. Implicit return: An implicit return is a way of returning values without using the keyword "return" within the function. 

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods enclosed in a do/end statement or between curly braces, they can also have multiple arguments separated by pipe characters (|)

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are data structures that store items by associated keys or key value pairs.
